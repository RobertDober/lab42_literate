## Literate Programming Ã  la doctest in Elxir.

[Elixir Doctest](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/docs-tests-and-with.html#doctests)  has inspired this gem.

Of course Elixir doctests from the metadata of a compiled elixir source (beam).

As in Ruby we do not have any metadata this works with simple text extraction and evalutaion.

This gives us however the possibility to write our doctests in **any** file and allows you
to assure that your `README.md` code examples are **all correct**.


Just extract code blocks from any file, and run them as specs with a simple `doctest file` in an RSpec example group.

### Installation

      gem install lab42_literate

or in Gemfile

      gem 'lab42_literate'

Then in your `spec_helper`

      require 'lab42/literate'

which makes the `doctest` method available in all example groupes of type `literate`.

### Very Quick Start

You can write RSpec example code inside a ` ```ruby literate ` block.

        ```ruby literate
          expect(%w{a b c}).not_to be_empty
        ```

There is an easy way to express `expect(...).to eq(...)` with the following special form...

        ```ruby literate
          1 + 41 #=> 42
        ```

Then, assuming the above text being inside a file `some_literate.md` one can execute the two examples above
with

        RSpec.describe 'example', type: :literate do
          doctest 'some_literate.md'
        end


### How does it work?

Each block ` ```ruby literate`  creates an example group with title `"literate block in #{file}:#{start_lnb}..#{end_lnb}"`.

Then an anonymous example `it do ...` 
and instance_evals the lines from the block in this example's context.


### Setup?


#### Inside the spec calling `doctest`


Given this literate file

      ```ruby literate
          foo.reverse #=> 'oof'
      ```

will perfectly work if you setup your spec as follows

```ruby
    RSpec.describe 'FOO', type: :literate do
      let(:foo){ 'foo' }
      doctest('literate_file.md')
    end
```


#### Inside the literal file itself

All literate blocks containing a  `Given` block inside the document will be
executed in the context in which `doctest` has been called, **before** the
example blocks will be generated, thusly the following literate file will
succeed

    ```ruby literate
        Given do
          let(:a){ 1 }
        end
    ```
    
    ```ruby literate
        a + b #=> 42
    ```

    ```ruby literate
        Given do
          let(:b){ 41 }
        end
    ```


**N.B.** It follows from this behaviour that one cannot put a `Given do ... end`  and code to be exceuted inside the
generated examples into the same ` ```ruby literate ` block.


### Explicit Title of the generated Example Group

Just add text  after ` ```ruby literate`

E.g.

      ```ruby literate Assure errors are empty

          ...
          expect(errors).to be_empty
          
      ```

### Calling `doctest` inside an Example

Will be deprecated.

Does not support all features.

Use at own risk.
